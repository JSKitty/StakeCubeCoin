## Importing wallet balances from SCC 1.0.3 wallets into SCC 2.0 wallets ##

SCC has migrated to a completely new codebase, and as such, is no longer compatible with the previous network and blockchain used by the old 1.0.3 wallets.
As part of the migration to the SCC 2.0 wallets and network, users can redeem their old wallet balances* into their new wallets.
This process is simple, but if not done correctly could risk you losing all your coins.

## NEVER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES GIVE AWAY YOUR PRIVATE KEYS TO ANYONE, THE ONE WHO HAS YOUR KEYS CONTROLS YOUR SCC ##

Please follow these simple steps
1) BACKUP your old SCC wallet, make multiple copies (most critical is your wallet.dat file!)
2) Copy that back up somewhere safe e.g USB drive, seperate computer.
3) Make a list of your wallet addresses (you may need to look in "coin control" for a full list). If coin control is not available in the send tab of your wallet, then activate this under `Å›ettings / Options / Wallet / Enable Coin Control Features`
4) For each wallet address (that you know has a balance of SCC) in debug console run `dumpprivkey 7enteryourmuewalletaddresshere`
5) Record the private key (securely & safely) that is printed there
6) As per item 2) Backup your old SCC wallet (just to be sure).  Again, critical is your wallet.dat file
7) Uninstall your old SCC wallet IF you are installing the 2.0 wallet on the same machine (to avoid any conflicts). For the sake of safety, you may also rename your SCC folder to say SCC-1.0.3-backup so it is preserved on your machine if things go wrong.
8) Install the new SCC 2.0 wallet
9) In debug console run `importprivkey KenterYourPrivateKeyHere "comment"`

You should now see your old SCC balance re-instated into the new SCC 2.0 wallet.
For security, we *strongly recommend* you now send those coins to yourself to a newly generated receive address created in your own 2.0 wallet.
